The Compassomator
=================
A bundle to simplify the development with Compass/SASS with symfony2 bundles. It is intended to be used in conjunction with Assetic and not as a replacement. In addition, it adds a file importer to SASS that is able to resolve the familiar **@BundleName** notation and also the SASS script function **bundle-public('@BundleName/foo.img')** to built the correct path to any asset in the bundles public directory.

# The Idea
Use compass to manage every bundle as a standalone project and use a special file importer to reference assets in other bundles. The generated CSS files are then referenced in Assetic.

# Requirements
Any Symfony2 2.3+ application will do.

# Installation
```bash
composer require asoc/compassomator-bundle
```

# Configuration
The compassomator is also able to trigger *assetic:dump* and *assetic:dump --watch* (*assetic:watch* respectively) if it is desired. To enable it, set the following option:

```yaml
asoc_compassomator:
	manage_assetic: true
```

# Quick Setup
1. Create a simple config.rb file inside every bundle inside the *Resources/* directory with the following content:

```ruby
css_dir = "public/css"
sass_dir = "sass"
```

Any generated CSS file will be places inside the bundles *Resources/public/css* directory, every SCSS/SASS file that should be compiled by Compass will be searched in *Resources/sass*.

2. Add the *Resources/public/css* to the *.gitignore* in the project root. In this setup it is assumed, that there are NO css files in the public/css directory that are not generated by Compass/SASS. If there are, it might be required to choose another *css_dir*.

3. Reference the generated CSS files with the usual Assetic helper in the view:

```twig
{% stylesheets
'@BundleName/Resources/public/css/foo.css'
'@BundleName/Resources/public/css/bar.css'
%}
...
{% endstylesheets %}
```

4. Run the compassomator (will also run assetic:dump)

```bash
app/console compassomator:compile
```

If assetic is not run automatically (manage_assetic: true), dumping the assets with assetic is also required:

```bash
app/console assetic:dump
```

5. Run compass watch and assetic dump in the background to automatically update the generated CSS.

```bash
# Start
app/console compassomator:watch
# End
app/console compassomator:watch --abort
```

If assetic is not run automatically (manage_assetic: true), watching the assets with assetic is also required:

```bash
app/console assetic:dump --watch (Symfony 2.3)
app/console assetic:watch (Symfony 2.4+)
```

6. Show logs

To view any errors, compass or assetic, the logs can be shown using the logs command.

```bash
app/console compassomator:logs
```

Made possible by [BITE GmbH](https://www.b-ite.de) as a side project during my master thesis.

# Notes
- At the moment, cache:clear will trigger the compassomator:compile command once, so it will take a few seconds longer on a cache:clear by default.
